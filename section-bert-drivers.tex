\chapter{BERT Drivers}
\label{sec:bert-drivers}

This chapter describes all of the available drivers for bit error rate testers (BERTs)

\section{Antikernel Labs}

\subsection{akl.crossbar}

This is the driver for the \href{https://github.com/azonenberg/triggercrossbar}{AKL-TXB1} trigger crossbar and CDR
trigger system. The front panel transceiver ports can also be used as a BERT.

\section{MultiLANE}

\begin{tabularx}{16cm}{lllX}
\thickhline
\textbf{Device Family} & \textbf{Driver} & \textbf{Transport} & \textbf{Notes} \\
\thickhline
ML4039-BTP & mlbert & lan & Use \href{https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal-mlbert-bridge}{scopehal-mlbert-bridge} \\
\thickhline
\end{tabularx}

\subsection{mlbert}

This driver is intended to connect via the
\href{https://github.com/ngscopeclient/scopehal-mlbert-bridge}{scopehal-mlbert-bridge} server for network transparency
and does not directly link to the MultiLANE SDK or talk directly to the instrument. The bridge requires a Windows PC
since MultiLANE's SDK is Windows only, however the libscopehal clientside driver can run on any supported OS.

It was developed using a ML4039-BTP but may work with other similar models as well.
